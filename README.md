## Editing Practices

All images are found in the <i>_site/assets</i> folder. When uploading images for a specific website or blog post, please create a special and clearly marked folder within <i>_site/assets</i>.

## Adding Pages

Add pages by creating a folder with the desired page name and adding an index.html page within that folder. This allows for better organization and cleaner URLs.
