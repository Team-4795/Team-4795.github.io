## Editing Practices

### Images
All images are found in the `assets` folder. When uploading images for a specific website or blog post, please create a special and clearly marked folder within `assets`.

To add images to the front page carousel, place them in `assets/carousel`. Amal's wonderful programming will take care of the rest.

### New Pages
To create a new page from the homepage, create a folder with the desired page name and then an 'index.md' file within that. This serves to improve organization and clean up URLs. Remember to add the page to 'nav.html' when necessary.
