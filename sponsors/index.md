SIM-RTP has promoted technology and education for 20 years and allows a diverse and experienced membership of IT professionals to communicate and learn. They first sponsored us in 2016 and have continued to ever since, making them our primary sponsor. We have visited SIM-RTP to present on FRC and our team’s progress twice, and hope to continue to in the future.

All of our members attend this school, and one of our mentors is an alumni. The school has generously provided of the use of their space, machine shop and more. We have recently received a sponsorship from the school’s PTSA which has funded our attendance at THOR, an off-season competition.

Ten-Thousand Villages sells handmade goods made in developing nations fostering development and ethical practices. In late 2016, Ten-Thousand Villages generously allowed us to take home a percentage of the money made on a certain day. We helped out around the store all day and many families and friends were able to buy unique gifts for the holidays.
