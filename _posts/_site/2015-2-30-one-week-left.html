<p>Get HYPE, eastbots, only one more school week until Kickoff! </p>

<p>So far, you all have been great. Hopefully you guys have learned something over the past few weeks of workshop. Trust me, you’ll definitely be learning more in the coming weeks of build season. </p>

<p>Mark your calendars, cause we’re about to have a slew of robotics events coming our way. </p>
