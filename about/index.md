In 2012-2013, the Eastbots began as a team of 8 people and 1 dedicated mentor who worked hard to develop our first ever robot. That school year we competed at NC FIRST’s Ultimate Ascent and paved a path for future members to follow.

The next year, in the 2013-2014 season, Eastbots grew to a larger group of people, with more people joining and becoming dedicated members. The team competed in the FIRST Aerial Assist regional tournament and that fall they placed as a member of the 2nd place alliance at THOR, setting new goals for the Eastbots.

In our third year, team 4795 designed and built a robot to adhere to the challenges of FIRST Recycle Rush, and again we competed at the regional tournament and at THOR, and with our previous experience we managed to have smoother competitions than ever before.

In the 2015-2016 season, Eastbots grew to almost double its previous members and as a result of the team’s very first elections, 4795 was able to reach new goals in fundraising, outreach, and organization. The game in 2016 was FIRST Stronghold and due to a new format of tournaments we made it to the quarterfinals in both of our district tournaments and qualified for states, where we were team captain of the 3rd place alliance, the highest ranking we have ever gotten. 

In the future we look to grow our team to more than just engineers and programmers, to start our own FIRST Lego League team in the CHCCS area and to compete at THOR for stronghold and in next year’s game.
