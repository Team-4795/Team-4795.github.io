In fall of 2012, the Eastbots began in Chapel Hill, North Carolina at East Chapel Hill High School as a team of 8 people and 2 dedicated mentors who worked hard to develop our first ever robot. That competition season (2012-2013) we competed at NC FIRSTâ€™s Ultimate Ascent and paved a path for future members to follow.

The next year, in the 2013-2014 season, Eastbots began to expand, with more people joining and becoming dedicated members. The team competed in the FIRST Aerial Assist regional tournament and in autumn of 2014 we reached new heights as we placed with an alliance of two other teams in 2nd at an off-season event called THOR.

In our third year, Team 4795 designed and built a robot to adhere to the challenges of FIRST Recycle Rush, and again we competed at the regional tournament and at THOR, and with our previous experience we managed to have smoother competitions than ever before.

In the 2015-2016 season, the Eastbots grew to almost double its previous size, and as a result we were able to achieve new goals in fundraising, outreach, and organization. The game in 2016 was FIRST Stronghold, with a new and improved format for tournaments; we made it to the quarterfinals in both of our district tournaments and qualified for the state championships, where we led an alliance of two other teams to the semi-finals, the team's highest achievement in competition at that time. 

In the 2016-2017 season, the Eastbots continued to grow in size and competed in FIRST Steamworks, becoming finalists at the Raleigh District Event. One of our mentors was also a finalist for the Woodie Flowers Award at the State Championship.

In the 2017-2018 season, competing in FIRST Power Up, we made Chapel Hill history by becoming the first Chapel Hill robotics team to qualify for the World Championships in Houston. Growing to over 40 members and 6 mentors, we built our most consistent and competitive robot to date; we also attended an out-of-state event for the first time in team history. In addition to qualifying for the World Championship, we were finalists at the Forsyth County event, and won the Innovation in Control award at the same event.

In the future we look to continue this development and achieve more than ever. We look to expand our team to more than just engineers and programmers as we seek people to help organization and marketing. We look to help spread STEM education to others in the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City School district by helping to start at FIRST Lego League team at a local middle school. We are confident that we can focus, hone, and continue our past success.
