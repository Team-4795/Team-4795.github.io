[FIRST](firstinspires.org), aka For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, is a youth organization that operates the robotics league that we attend every year. FIRST was founded in 1989 to inspire young people's interest and participation in science and technology. It designs accessible, innovative programs that motivate young people to pursue education and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math, while building experience and life skills. In the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), students are tasked with designing, building, programming, and testing a robot within a limited time span. In early January, teams receive the rules of a robotics game, which changes every year, and a kit of basic parts. In order to solve the problems posed by the yearâ€™s challenge, teams create and execute designs, program mechanisms, and integrate systems to build a robot. This robot goes on to compete in the challenge against other teams from around the state, nation, and world.
