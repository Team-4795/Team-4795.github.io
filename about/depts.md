Mechanical - The mechanical team builds our robot. They machine all the parts as well as organize where they all fit on the robot. They design challenging mechanisms, and also handle repairs to our robot at competition. 

Electrical -  The electrical team designs and builds our electrical board, and all the components of the robot that allow it to move and sense. They also design custom circuit boards for our robot. 

Design - The design team plans and uses CAD, computer-aided design, to help the mechanical and electrical teams outline their plans. 

Programming - The programming team develops the code and the software that controls our robot and allows it to compete.

Fundraising - The fundraising team writes grants, organizes sponsorships, and reaches out to businesses to obtain funding for the team. This money is used mainly for the registration fees for competitions, as well as certain parts that the mechanical or electrical subteams may need,

Outreach - The outreach team organizes events to share the message of STEM around our community. The local schools, companies, and organizations of Chapel Hill and Carrboro support the influx of leadership skills and STEM awareness, and the East Chapel Hill Robotics Team gladly returns the favor and educates our community.
